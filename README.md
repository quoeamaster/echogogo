# echogogo
echo server written in Golang. It is easy to deploy as it is written in Go! echogogo tends to help in testing as well, since you could deploy mocking modules on it and simply mocking an end server / api providing necessary responses.

## modularization of features
by default, the echo module is included and hence provides a simple echo feature on the received messages. The respond could be in the form of json, xml or plain test.
